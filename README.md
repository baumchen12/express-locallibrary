The Main learning objectives for this project was to understand how to set 
up the front end and back end of a web site and database. We learned how to 
connect the two using things such as a mongoose database. 

There were a few challenges that I ran into. One example was when I coded
something wrong. I didn't have a word captalized and that messed up the
entire page on the website. Something like this, that was so small was 
very tough for me to catch. Honestly, its just a matter of being careful
and checking the errors and where they say you're errors are at in order 
to correct those mistakes. Another problem that I had was that I had missed 
a few lines of code that I completely forgot to add in. This is also just a matter 
of checking over the errors and just studying the code a little closer. 

I can see this tutorial being very helpful for those first timers. It will 
take you through the entire set up process alongside with all of the coding. 
Its perfect for walking people through this and showing how it will work.
